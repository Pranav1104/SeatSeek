            Thundering waterfalls, glaciers, the Northern Lights, and dramatic
            cliffs full of birdlife: Iceland has gained fame as an outdoor
            destination for lots of valid reasons. A wonderful introduction to
            the beauty this Nordic country has to offer is the Golden Circle.
            This popular route takes you to the stunning Gullfoss waterfalls,
            the lava fields of Thingvellir National Park, and the Geysir area
            full of bubbling mud pools, a spouting geyser, and smoke rising up
            from the earth. .

            The Dolomites are known for their characteristic pointy granite
            rocks. This northern Italian region is what most outdoor explorers
            dream about. The Dolomites attract rock climbers, mountain bikers,
            and hikers who come here for the challenging routes and rewarding
            scenery. Summer is the season for rafting and hiking. It’s
            recommended to choose a trail around the Three Peaks: connecting
            mountains that are iconic for the Dolomites. Other desirable tracks
            lead to some magnificent lakes, such as Lago di Carezza and Lago di
            Sorapiss

            When most travelers make their way over to Malaysia, they tend to
            visit islands like Penang, Langkawi, or Perhentian Kecil. While I
            have been to all of these destinations, and really do love them —
            I’m always telling people that they are truly missing out if they do
            not visit this little paradise called Pulau Kapas.This island is the
            ideal place for a relaxing escape, but also for the adventurous
            soul. The snorkeling just a few meters off the beach is absolutely
            mind-blowing! You’re guaranteed to swim with turtles, hundreds of
            different species of fish, and even spot a few sharks if you’re
            lucky.There are also two different jungle hikes through the island
            that is well worth your time, and you can even rent your own boat to
            cruise around and find your own private beach.One of my favorite
            parts about visiting though is the beach camping on Pulau Kapas. You
            don’t even have to bring your own tent, as you can rent one there.
            The camping vibe is awesome, and you’ll definitely meet some awesome
            fellow travelers.”

            Located 11km north of Koh Phangan and about 2 hours south of Koh Tao
            is a landmass known as Sail Rock. Because it is the only landmass
            between the two islands, it supports the breeding cycle of many
            species, the most notable of these being Bull Sharks. Traditionally
            thought of as an aggressive shark, being in the water with these
            gracious, powerful, and beautiful animals is the ultimate adrenaline
            rush.The dives at this site usually consist of a lap around the
            rock, and although the sharks are not known to swim right up to the
            rock’s surface, they can be often found gliding around just a few
            meters away.

            Cambodia isn’t just a country known for ancient ruins and a brutal
            civil war. Adventurers will love the opportunity to get off the
            beaten track here and explore some of the lesser-known spots while
            traveling in their Southeast Asia adventures here at Cambodia. One
            adventure that can’t be missed is taking a trip up the Mekong River
            to see the famous pink dolphins, as well as all the other amazing
            activities to do in Stung Treng, a province in northern Cambodia.The
            journey starts in the city of Stung Treng where you can cycle,
            motorcycle or catch a long-tail boat up the Mekong, close to the
            Cambodia-Laos border town of Preah Rumkel. From there you can trek
            out even further up the river to the colossal waterfalls. As the
            sunsets over the Mekong River, you can see the rare pink river
            dolphins swimming and playing in the water. .
